abstract = "The notion of rationality plays a crucial role in Decision Aiding (DA), both as a scientific discipline and as a professional practice. Indeed, a pervasive and possibly constitutive feature of DA is that it constantly faces challenges as to whether it is valid, legitimate, useful, practical, etc. Rationality plays a pivotal role in participating to determine whether DA fulfills such requirements. In this article, we take advantage of arguments developed in the philosophical literature, mainly by Habermas, to introduce a framework defining a series of conceptions of rationality. We use this framework in order to introduce a typology of DA approaches, distinguishing objectivist, conformist, adjustive and reflexive approaches. Whereas the underlying conception of rationality plays a key role in determining the features of DA processes, we argue that tools are largely independent of conceptions of rationality. Our reasoning has direct operational implications, which makes it of distinctive interest, not only for philosophers and operational research theoreticians, but also for practitioners. We explain how practitioners should reason in practice to identify which DA approach they should implement in a given situation. We then explain how they can take advantage of our analysis to entrench the legitimacy and validity of their recommendations."

In the second part, it is shown how informal notions of rationality were among the tacit heuristic principles that led to the discovery of generalized models of decision put forward in the early eighties to replace the received model.},

	title = {On justifying the norms underlying decision support},
	keywords = {Deliberated judgment},
	abstract = {When decision sciences are applied to concrete problems, Decision Makers (DMs), concerned stakeholders, and the general public typically expect clear recommendations.
As emphasized in particular in the literature on ethical dimensions of Operational Research practice, such recommendations are unavoidably conditioned by norms or normative conceptions.
Although an extensive literature is devoted to promoting certain norms designed to be largely accepted by decision analysts, studies specifically devoted to determine, at a general level, how decision analysts can decide which norms should underlie their work, are found lacking.
To make up for this lacuna, we flesh out the concept of justification. 
We develop requirements that any justification should satisfy to qualify for being able to justify norms on which recommendations can rest.
We then introduce and recommend a series of practical rules that decision analysts should abide by, on the basis of which, in a given decision situation, a decision analyst can decide, together with the DM, whether a given norm underlying a given recommendation can be adopted.

The principle was instantiated both correlationally and experimentally. An individual differences version was used to examine whether individuals higher in tendencies toward reflective thought and in cognitive ability would be more likely to behave normatively. In a second application of the understanding/acceptance principle, subjects were presented with arguments both for and against normative choices and it was observed whether, on a readministration of the task, performance was more likely to move in a normative direction. Several discrepancies between performance and normative models could be explained by the understanding/acceptance principle. However, several gaps between descriptive and normative models (particularly those deriving from some noncausal base rate problems) were not clarified by the understanding/acceptance principle—they could not be explained in terms of varying task understanding or tendencies toward reflective thought. The results demonstrate how the variation and instability in responses can be analyzed to yield inferences about why descriptive and normative models of human reasoning and decision making sometimes do not coincide.},

It does so by confronting the main theories of distributive justice with data from (mostly) questionnaire experiments. The book starts with an extensive discussion on why empirical social choice makes sense and how it should be done. It then presents various experimental results relating to theories of distributive justice, including the Rawlsian equity axiom, Harsanyi's version of utilitarianism, utilitarianism with a floor, responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism, the claims problem and fairness in health.},

	abstract = {With the 1954 publication of his Foundations of Statistics, in which he proposed a basis that takes into account not only strictly objective and repetitive events, but also vagueness and interpersonal differences, Leonard J. Savage opened the greatest controversy in modern statistical thought. His theory of the foundations, connected with the personalistic interpretation of probability, challenged the then dominant frequentist school. In the first seven chapters of his book, Professor Savage is concerned with the foundations at a relatively deep level. To explain and defend his theory of the behavior of a highly idealized person faced with uncertainty, he considers decision making, the sure-thing principle, qualitative and quantitative personal probability, the approach to certainty through experience, symmetric sequences of events, critical comments on personal probability, utility, observations as they affect the decision, and partition problems. In chapters eight through seventeen he discusses statistics proper — the actual devices of the discipline — from the personalistic view. He concentrates on minimax problems and on the theories of estimation and testing. Exercises are included throughout to reinforce and supplement the text. The mathematical techniques used are quite elementary, some calculus and elementary probability theory being presupposed. Understanding of all the material calls for some mathematical maturity on the part of the reader. Professor Savage had reevaluated his position somewhat during the decade and a half since the work was first published. While reaffirming the material in the first seven chapters, he had reconsidered the appropriateness of many frequentistic applications. To explain these recent developments, he added a new preface, new footnotes, and a supplementary 180-item, annotated bibliography. Because of Professor Savage's death, the revisions that he made for this edition are his final analysis of the situation.As he says on page one, "the foundations are the most controversial parts of many, if not all, sciences." In statistics, the foundation of probability is "as controversial a subject as one could name." In 1954, the controversy was very great, and although it has quieted since, the problem has yet to be resolved. A new generation of readers who have missed Savage's analysis have here an opportunity to study firsthand what his important foundation of statistics — personal probability — is, and what it means to statistical thought.},

	abstract = {Few attempts have yet been made to interrelate the major axiom systems of expected utility theory such as those presented by von Neumann—Morgenstern, Marschak, Savage, and Arrow. This paper attempts to consolidate the theoretical and empirical research on these axioms by showing the correspondences among the major axioms of each system and highlighting their similarities and differences in dealing with concepts such as probability and utility. Allais, Ellsberg, and others have proposed decision problems which are designed to elicit choices which violate the utility axioms. To the extent that people accept the axioms, choices which violate the axioms can be considered ‘paradoxical’. Whether people make such choices is an empirical matter, and we therefore investigate the rate of violation in previous and new experimental studies. Our results show that although there is considerable violation of the utility axioms, the rate can fall drastically as the probability and pay-off parameters are varied away from critical levels. To provide a better understanding of the implications of the axioms and their relationship to some of the decision ‘paradoxes’, we have stated the implications as ‘rules’. Since the subjects were asked to rate the appeal of each rule as a decision norm, we can determine the relative attractiveness of each rule and can show the relationship between subjects’ actual choices and their agreement with the rules which guide choice. We found that people often prefer rules which contradict choices they have made.},

	abstract = {This article offers an exegesis of the passages in von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944, 1947, 1953) that discuss their conception of utility. It is occasioned by two factors. First, as we approach the semicentennial of the publication of Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, its immense impact on economic thought in the intervening years encourages serious reflection on its authors' ideas. Second, misleading statements about the theory continue to appear. The article will have accomplished its purpose if it helps others appreciate the genius and spirit of the theory of utility fashioned by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern.},
