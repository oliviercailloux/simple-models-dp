\section{Motivation}

\section{Normative theories}
\subsection{Definition}
A normative theory is a tuple $(\allprops, ¬, \allargs, I, (\ileadsto)_{i \in I})$, 
with ${\ileadsto} \subseteq \allhist × \Phi$, 
where $\allhist = \bigcup_{k \in \N} \allargs^{\intvl{1, k}}$ denotes all finite sequences of elements in $\allargs$ (including the empty sequence) and $\Phi = \allprops × \set{\mathit{poss}, \mathit{sure}}$. (Throughout the article, $\N$ includes zero, and note that $\intvl{1, 0} = \emptyset$.)  

The symbol $¬$ is a negation operator on $\allprops$, such that $\forall \prop \in \allprops: ¬¬\prop = \prop$. This article also uses this symbol as a negation operator on $\Phi$, defined as follows, $\forall \prop \in \allprops$: $¬\propposs = (¬\prop, \mathit{sure})$ and $¬\propsure = (¬\prop, \mathit{poss})$. Observe that $¬¬\phi = \phi$. (The symbol $¬$ is also used in this article to negate classical mathematical propositions; this should create no confusion.)
As usual with binary relations, $\hist \nileadsto \phi$ means $(\hist, \phi) \notin {\ileadsto}$.

Given $i \in I, \phi \in \Phi, \hist \in \allhist$, say that $\hist$ leads strongly to $\phi$ iff $\hist \ileadsto \phi \land \hist \nileadsto ¬\phi$.
Define $\hist \ileadstost \phi$ iff $[\hist \text{ leads strongly to } \phi] \land [\phi = \propsure ⇒ \hist \text{ leads strongly to } \propposs]$.
(The visual proximity of the symbols $\ileadsto$ and $\ileadstost$ creates a small risk of confusion, but I feel it is justified by the fact that $\ileadsto$ is not used in the rest of this article, except in the proof of \cref{th:protcoh}.)
Given $\hist \in \allhist$, let $\histend$ denote the set containing the last two elements of the sequence $\hist$ if the sequence has at least two elements; the singleton set containing the last element of the sequence if it has exactly one element; and the empty set if $\hist = \emptyset$.
Given $i \in I, \phi \in \Phi, \ar \in \allargs$, define $\ar \ileadstost \phi$ iff $\forall \hist \in \allhist \suchthat \ar \in \histend: \hist \ileadstost \phi$.

\subsection{Classify propositions}
\begin{axiom}[Normative adequacy]
	\label{ax:norm}
	$\forall i \in I, \phi \in \Phi: 
		[(\exists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstost \phi) \land ¬(\exists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstost ¬\phi)] ⇒ \phi \in \iPhi \land ¬\phi \notin \iPhi.$
\end{axiom}

\Cref{ax:norm} is actually equivalent to the following property.
\begin{property}[Simple normative adequacy]
	\label{ax:snorm}
	$\forall i \in I, \phi \in \Phi: 
		[\exists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstost \phi] ⇒ \phi \in \iPhi \land ¬\phi \notin \iPhi.$
\end{property}

To see why this hold, consider the following definition.
\begin{definition}[Protocol coherence]
	\label{def:protcoh}
	$\forall i \in I, \phi \in \Phi$:
	\begin{equation}
		[\exists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstost \phi] ⇒ [\nexists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstost ¬\phi].
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}
	\label{th:protcoh}
	Any normative theory satisfies Protocol coherence.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Protocol coherence is satisfied by definition of $\ileadstost$. Indeed, if for some $\ar \in \allargs$, $\ar \ileadstost \phi$, then $\forall \ar_1 \in \allargs: (\ar_1, \ar) \nileadsto ¬\phi$; thus, for any $\ar' \in \allargs$, $\ar' \ileadstost ¬\phi$ is false, because it requires that $\forall \ar_1 \in \allargs: (\ar', \ar_1) \ileadsto ¬\phi$, and thus in particular, that $(\ar', \ar) \ileadsto ¬\phi$.
\end{proof}

That \cref{ax:norm} is equivalent to \cref{ax:snorm} immediately follows from \cref{th:protcoh}.
\begin{proposition}
	\label{th:normeqsnorm}
	Any normative theory satisfies Normative adequacy iff it satisfies simple normative adequacy.
\end{proposition}

To further analyze this and related matters, given a normative theory and $i \in I$, say that a proposition $\phi \in \Phi$ is \emph{$i$-decidable} iff $\exists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstost \phi \lor \ar \ileadstost ¬\phi$.
The $i$-decidable propositions are those on which the normative theory permits to take a position. It will generally be unknown in practical applications, and may be empty.
The next property ensures an unambiguous interpretation of the content of $\iPhi$ for all $i$-decidable propositions. In this definition, $\oplus$ denotes the exclusive disjunction; thus $\phi \in \iPhi \oplus ¬\phi \in \iPhi$ is equivalent to: $\phi \in \iPhi ⇔ ¬\phi \notin \iPhi$. It can be seen to hold by using \cref{th:normeqsnorm}.

\begin{property}[Restricted interpretability]
	\label{def:restrinterpr}
	$\forall i \in I, \phi \in \Phi: [\exists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstost \phi \lor \ar \ileadstost ¬\phi] ⇒ [\phi \in \iPhi \oplus ¬\phi \in \iPhi]$.
\end{property}

\subsection{Non-completeness}
\begin{definition}[Theory completeness]
	$\forall \phi \in \Phi: [\exists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstost \phi] \lor [\exists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstost ¬\phi]$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Unrestricted interpretability]
	$\forall \phi \in \Phi: \phi \in \iPhi \oplus ¬\phi \in \iPhi$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Deliberation completeness]
	$\forall \phi \in \Phi: \phi \in \iPhi \lor ¬\phi \in \iPhi$.
\end{definition}
The following proposition directly follows from the definitions, together with \cref{th:protcoh}.
\begin{proposition}
	1) Under Normative adequacy, Theory completeness implies Deliberation completeness. 2) Unrestricted interpretability implies Deliberation completeness.
\end{proposition}
Theories as defined here do not mandate Theory completeness. This is good for two reasons. First, even the weaker Deliberation completeness can be considered too strong. Second, it is dubious that, for non trivial decision problems, theories can be found for which both Normative adequacy is normatively compelling and Theory completeness holds.

\section{Additive single-answer empirical theories}
\subsection{Definition}
An empirical theory for a normative theory is a tuple $(\gleadsto, \gbeats, \alldargs, \dbeats, +)$,
with ${\gleadsto} \subseteq \allargs × \Phi$, 
${\gbeats} \subseteq \allargs × \allargs$ and is irreflexive,
${\dbeats} \subseteq \alldargs × \allargs$ and is injective and its range includes $\gbeatsinv(\allargs)$ (thus $\forall \ar_1 \suchthat [\exists \ar_0 \suchthat \ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0]$: $\dbeatsinv(\ar_1)$ is a singleton). 
Define $\df: \allargs → \powersetz{\allargs}$ as $\df = \dbeatsinv \circ \gbeatsinv$.
Given $\ar \in \allargs$, $\df(\ar)$ denotes the \emph{fragments defending $\ar$}. 
In other words, given $\ard \in \dargs$ and $\ar_0 \in \allargs$, $\ard \in \df(\ar_0)$ iff $\exists \ar_1 \in \allargs \suchthat \ard \dbeats \ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0$.
A \emph{coalition defending $\ar$} is any element of $\powersetz{\df(\ar)}$.
The symbol $+$ in an empirical theory stands for a function $+: \bigcup_{\ar \in \allargs}(\set{s} × \powersetz{\df(\ar)}) → \allargs$.
Given any $\ar \in \allargs$ and $\emptyset ≠ \dargs \subseteq \df(\ar)$, $\ar + \dargs$ means $+(\ar, \dargs)$. 
Given any $\ar \in \allargs$, define $\dfp(\ar)$, the \emph{defenders of $\ar$}, as $\dfp(\ar) = \set{\ar + \dargs \suchthat \emptyset ≠ \dargs \subseteq \df(\ar)}$.

An empirical theory must satisfy
$\exists k \in \N \suchthat (\dfp)^k(\gleadstoinv(\Phi)) = \emptyset$, where $(\dfp)^0$ is the identity function over $\allargs$.

\subsection{Falsifiability}
Given $\hist \in \allhist$, $\hist(\intvl{1, l(\hist)})$, where $l(\hist) \in \N$ is the length of the sequence $\hist$, denotes the range of $\hist$, that is, all arguments contained in the sequence $\hist$. Abusing notation, given $\args \subseteq \allargs$, I write $\args \cap \hist$ to designate $\args \cap \hist(\intvl{1, l(\hist)})$, therefore using simply $\hist$ in that expression to denote the \emph{range} of $\hist$.

Given $i \in I, \phi \in \Phi, \ar \in \allargs$ and $\args \subseteq \gbeatsinv(\ar)$, define $\args \ibeats \ar$ iff $\exists \hist \in \allhist \suchthat \args = \gbeatsinv(\ar) \cap \hist \land \ar \in \histend \land \hist \nileadstost \phi$. (The notation uses a striked through $\phi$ in superscript to suggest that when $\args \ibeats \ar$, the coalition $\args$ argues against $\phi$, from the point of view of $i$.)

Given $i \in I, \phi \in \gPhi, \ar \in \allargs$, define the $\di(\ar) \subseteq \powersetz{\alldargs}$ as $\di(\ar) = \set{\dbeatsinv(\args) \suchthat \emptyset ≠ \args \subseteq \gbeatsinv(\ar) \land \args \ibeats \ar}$. It represents the coalitions of fragments required to defend $\ar$ (when arguing for $\phi$) from the point of view of $i$. 
The following proposition shows that these coalitions can be added to $\ar$, and will be useful for other results.
\begin{proposition}
	\label{th:indf}
	$\forall i \in I, \phi \in \gPhi, \ar \in \allargs: \dargs \in \di(\ar) ⇒ \emptyset ≠ \dargs \subseteq \df(\ar)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let us prove that $\forall \ar \in \allargs: \set{\dbeatsinv(\args) \suchthat \emptyset ≠ \args \subseteq \gbeatsinv(\ar)} = \powersetz{\df(\ar)}$, from which the conclusion follows, and which can be useful to clarify the relationship between $\di(\ar)$ and $\df(\ar)$. Note that by definition of $\df(\ar)$, $\dargs \in \powersetz{\df(\ar)}$ iff $\emptyset ≠ \dargs \subseteq \dbeatsinv(\gbeatsinv(\ar))$. 
	Thus, we have to prove that
	$\forall \dargs \subseteq \allargs$:
	\begin{equation}
		\exists \emptyset ≠ \args \subseteq \gbeatsinv(\ar) \suchthat \dbeatsinv(\args) = \dargs ⇔ \emptyset ≠ \dargs \subseteq \dbeatsinv(\gbeatsinv(\ar)).
	\end{equation}

	First (from left to right), given any $\args \suchthat \emptyset ≠ \args \subseteq \gbeatsinv(\ar_0) \land \dargs = \dbeatsinv(\args)$, let us show that $\dargs ≠ \emptyset$ and that $\dargs \subseteq \dbeatsinv(\gbeatsinv(\ar))$. 
	Indeed, as $\args ≠ \emptyset$, we can pick some $\ar_1 \in \args$, from which follows that $\ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0$, hence, for some $\ard \in \alldargs$, $\ard \dbeats \ar_1$ (as mandated by ${\dbeats}$), thus $\ard \in \dargs$, hence $\dargs ≠ \emptyset$. Also, because $\args \subseteq \gbeatsinv(\ar)$, $\dbeatsinv(\args) \subseteq \dbeatsinv(\gbeatsinv(\ar))$. 
	
	Second (from right to left), let us show that $\emptyset ≠ \dargs \subseteq \dbeatsinv(\gbeatsinv(\ar)) ⇒ \exists \emptyset ≠ \args \subseteq \gbeatsinv(\ar_0) \suchthat \dbeatsinv(\args) = \dargs$. 
	Defining $\args = {\dbeats}(\dargs) \cap \gbeatsinv(\ar_0)$, we see that $\dbeatsinv(\args) = \dargs$: considering any $\ard \in \dargs$, $\ard \dbeats \ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0$ for some $\ar_1 \in \allargs$, thus, $\ar_1 \in \args$, thus, $\ard \in \dbeatsinv(\args)$; and considering any $\ar' \in \dbeatsinv(\args)$, $\ar' \dbeats \ar_1$ for some $\ar_1 \in \args$, thus $\ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0$, thus, $\ar_1 \in {\dbeats}(\dargs)$, thus $\ard \dbeats \ar_1$ for some $\ard \in \dargs$, and by injectivity  of $\dargs$, $\ar' = \ard$, whence $\ar' \in \dargs$. 
	That $\args ≠ \emptyset$ follows from $\dargs ≠ \emptyset$.
\end{proof}

Given $\ar \in \allargs$, define $\dip(\ar) = \set{(\ar + \dargs) \suchthat \dargs \in \di(\ar)}$, representing the subset of defenders of $\ar$ useful for proving $\phi$ from the point of view of $i$.
Given $i \in I, \phi \in \gPhi$, define $\gargs \subseteq \allargs$ as the transitive closure of ${\gleadstoinv}(\phi)$ under $\dip$: $\gargs = \cup_{k \in \N} (\dip)^k({\gleadstoinv}(\phi))$.

I write that $\ar$ \emph{$i$-defends} $\phi$ to mean that $\emptyset \nibeats \ar$. 

\begin{definition}[Convincingness]
	An empirical theory is \emph{convincing} iff $\forall i \in I, \phi \in \gPhi, \ar \in \gargs: \ar$ $i$-defends $\phi$.
\end{definition}

A \emph{falsification instance} of an empirical theory is a tuple $(i, \phi, \hist, \ar) \in I × \gPhi × \allhist × \gargs$ such that $\gbeatsinv(\ar) \cap \hist = \emptyset \land \ar \in \histend \land \hist \nileadstost \phi$. 
I also write that $(i, \phi, \hist, \ar)$ falsifies $\gamma$ to mean that it is a falsification instance of $\gamma$.

\begin{theorem}
	An empirical theory is convincing iff it has no falsification instances.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	For all $i \in I, \phi \in \gPhi, \ar \in \gargs$: $\ar$ does not $i$-defend $\phi$ iff $\exists \hist \in \allhist \suchthat \left[\gbeatsinv(\ar) \cap \hist = \emptyset \land \ar \in \histend \land \hist \nileadstost \phi\right]$ iff $\exists \hist \in \allhist$ such that $(i, \phi, \hist, \ar)$ falsifies $\gamma$. Therefore, $\gamma$ is not convincing iff $\exists (i, \phi, \ar) \suchthat \ar$ does not $i$-defend $\phi$ iff $\exists \hist \suchthat (i, \phi, \hist, \ar)$ falsifies $\gamma$ iff $\gamma$ has a falsification instance.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Validity]
	An empirical theory is \emph{valid} iff $\forall i \in I, \phi \in \gPhi: [\phi \in \iPhi \land ¬\phi \notin \iPhi]$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{th:produce}
	Given $\phi \in \gPhi$, $\ar_0 \in \gargs$ that $i$-defends $\phi$, and $\hist \nileadstost \phi$ with $\ar_0 \in \histend$, define $\args =  \gbeatsinv(\ar_0) \cap \hist$, $\dargs = \dbeatsinv(\args)$, and $\ar_2 = \ar_0 + \dargs$. Then, $\ar_2 \in \gargs \cap \dfp(\ar_0)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	By definition of $\ibeats$, $\args \ibeats \ar_0$.
	Also, because $\ar_0$ $i$-defends $\phi$, $\args ≠ \emptyset$. 
	Therefore, $\dargs \in \di(\ar_0)$.
	It follows that $\dargs \in \df(\ar_0)$, by \cref{th:indf}, and that $\ar_2 \in \dfp(\ar_0)$, by definition of $\dfp$. It also follows that $\ar_2 \in \dip(\ar_0)$, hence, that $\ar_2 \in \gargs$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	A normatively adequate and convincing empirical theory is valid.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Given any $i \in I$ and $\phi \in \gPhi$, suffices to show that for some $\ar \in \allargs$, $\ar \ileadstost \phi$; the conclusion then follows thanks to simple normative adequacy (equivalent to normative adequacy thanks to \cref{th:normeqsnorm}). 
	
	Lemma: $[\ar_0 \in \gargs \land \ar_0 \nileadstost \phi] ⇒ \exists \ar_2 \in \gargs \cap \dfp(\ar_0)$. That is because $\ar_0 \in \gargs ⇒ \ar_0$ $i$-defends $\phi$, by convincingness, and,
	by definition, $\ar_0 \nileadstost \phi$ means that $\exists \hist \in \allhist \suchthat \ar_0 \in \histend \land \hist \nileadstost \phi$; \cref{th:produce} thus applies.

	To prove the theorem, build a finite sequence of arguments in $\gargs$, starting with any $\ar_0 \in \gleadstoinv(\phi)$. Observe that $\ar_0 \in \gargs$. Given $k \in 2\N$, if $\ar_k \nileadstost \phi$, define $\ar_{k + 2}$ using the above lemma, obtaining $\ar_{k + 2} \in \gargs \cap (\dfp)^\frac{k + 2}{2}(\ar_0)$. Continue applying the lemma and producing further arguments as long as $\ar_k \nileadstost \phi$.
	By definition of an empirical theory, $\exists k \in \N \suchthat (\dfp)^k(\ar_0) = \emptyset$, thus, this process ends with some $\ar$ such that $\ar \ileadstost \phi$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Effectively comparing models}
Given $\phi \in \Phi$ and two empirical theories $\gamma$ and $\delta$ for a given normative theory, say that they disagree about $\phi$ iff $\phi \in \gPhi[\gamma] \land ¬\phi \in \gPhi[\delta]$. Say that they are incompatible iff there is at least one $\phi \in \Phi$ that they disagree about.

Given $\phi \in \Phi$, $\hist \in \allhist$ and $\ar_\gamma \in \gargs$, say that $(\hist, \ar_\gamma)$ challenges $\phi$ iff $\hist \nileadstost \phi$ and $\ar_\gamma \in \histend$.
Given $\phi \in \Phi, \ar_\gamma \in \gargs, \ar_\delta \in \gargsdelta$, say that $(\hist, \ar_\gamma, \ar_\delta)$ is a $\phi/¬\phi$-challenge iff $(\hist, \ar_\gamma)$ challenges $(\gamma, \phi)$ or $(\hist, \ar_\delta)$ challenges $(\delta, ¬\phi)$.

\begin{lemma}
	\label{th:endchal}
	Given $\ar_\gamma \in \gargs$, $\ar_\delta \in \gargsdelta$ and $\hist \in \allhist$ such that $\set{\ar_\gamma, \ar_\delta} \subseteq \histend$: $(\hist, \ar_\gamma, \ar_\delta)$ is a $\phi/¬\phi$-challenge.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Either $\hist \nileadstost \phi$, and $(\hist, \ar_\gamma)$ challenges $\phi$, or $\hist \ileadstost \phi$, hence, by \cref{th:protcoh}, $\hist \nileadstost ¬\phi$, and $(\hist, \ar_\delta)$ challenges $¬\phi$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{th:nextchal}
	Given $(\hist, \ar_\gamma)$ challenging $\phi$, with $\ar_\gamma \in \gargs \cap (\dfp)^k(\gleadstoinv(\phi))$, and $\ar_\delta \in \gargsdelta$: either $(i, \phi, \hist, \ar_\gamma)$ falsifies $\gamma$, or there exists a $\phi/¬\phi$-challenge $(\histp, \ar'_\gamma, \ar_\delta)$, with $\ar'_\gamma \in \gargs \cap (\dfp)^{k + 1}(\gleadstoinv(\phi))$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	If $\ar_\gamma$ does not $i$-defend $\phi$, then $(i, \phi, \hist, \ar_\gamma)$ falsifies $\gamma$, which ends the proof. 
	Thus, assume that $\ar_\gamma$ $i$-defends $\phi$. 

	\Cref{th:produce} applies and yields $\ar'_\gamma = \ar_\gamma + \dbeatsinv(\gbeatsinv(\ar_\gamma)) \in \gargs \cap \dfp(\ar_\gamma)$, thus $\ar'_\gamma \in (\dfp)^{(k + 1)}(\gleadstoinv(\phi))$. 
	Now, define $\histpp = (\hist, \ar'_\gamma)$ and test whether $\histpp \nileadstost \phi$. 
	
	If $\histpp \nileadstost \phi$, define $\histp = \histpp$, and observe that $(\histp, \ar'_\gamma, \ar_\delta)$ challenges $\phi$, which concludes the proof. 
	Thus, assume that $\histpp \ileadstost \phi$. 

	Let us now define $\histp$ such that $\set{\ar'_\gamma, \ar_\delta} \subseteq \histpend$, so that \cref{th:endchal} applies on $(\histp, \ar'_\gamma, \ar_\delta)$, which will conclude the proof. 
	
	If $\ar_\delta \in \histppend$, this is done by defining $\histp = \histpp$. Otherwise, define $\histp = (\histpp, \ar_\delta)$ and test whether $\histp \nileadstost \phi$. 
\end{proof}

%Given a normative theory and two empirical theories for that normative theory and $i \in I$, 
%a \emph{test procedure with $i$} is a finite sequence 
\commentOC{Need the test procedure to be a tree. Atom: $(k, \phi)$ meaning whether ${\hist}^k \ileadstost \phi$. Branch label: atoms linked using or and and operators. From a node $n = (\hist, \ar, \phi)$, let branches depart, such that their labels do not overlap. From a node, if no branch label is true, the node must falsify a theory. In the case of the procedure below, it is not a list because we may query several times the same theory or switch to the other one, depending on the last answer. But if simplifying the theory (single-try), we may then simplify the definition of a test procedure.}

An increasing sequence of arguments is a finite sequence $({\hist}^k)_{k \in \intvl{1, N}}$, for some $N \in \N^*$, of sequences of arguments, 
such that $\forall k \in \intvl{2, N}, {\hist}^k$ starts with ${\hist}^{k-1}$, and 
such that $(i, \phi, {\hist}^N)$ falsifies one of the empirical theories for some $\phi \in \Phi$. 
A sequence of arguments $\histp$ starts with a sequence of arguments $\hist$ of length $l$ iff $\histp$ has length at least $l$ and $\forall k \in \intvl{1, l}: \histp_k = \hist_k$.

Given two incompatible empirical theories for a given normative theory, $\alpha = (\gleadsto[\alpha], \gbeats[\alpha], \alldargs_\alpha, \dbeats[\alpha], +_\alpha)$ and $\beta = (\gleadsto[\beta], \gbeats[\beta], \alldargs_\beta, \dbeats[\beta], +_\beta)$ and given any $i \in I$, the following procedure falsifies one of these theories, involve only $i$, and uses queries only about increasing sequences of arguments.
\begin{procedure}
	Pick any $\phi \in \Phi$ about which $\alpha$ and $\beta$ disagree.
	
	Given $k_\alpha, k_\beta \in \N, \hist \in \allhist, \ar_\alpha \in \gargsalpha, \ar_\beta \in \gargsbeta$, 
	say that 
	$(\hist, \ar_\alpha, \ar_\beta)$ is a challenge of complexity $(k_\alpha, k_\beta)$ iff 
	$(\hist, \ar_\alpha, \ar_\beta)$ is a $\phi/¬\phi$-challenge, $\ar_\alpha \in (\dfp[\alpha])^{k_\alpha}(\gleadstoinv[\alpha](\phi))$, and $\ar_\beta \in (\dfp[\beta])^{k_\beta}(\gleadstoinv[\beta](¬\phi))$.
	
	Pick any $\ar_{-1} \in \allargs \suchthat \ar_{-1} \gleadsto[\beta] ¬\phi$. Observe that $\ar_{-1} \in \gargsbeta \cap (\dfp[\beta])^0(\gleadstoinv[\beta](¬\phi))$. Test whether $(\ar_{-1}) \nileadstost \phi$. If so, $(i, \phi, (\ar_{-1}), \ar_{-1})$ falsifies $\beta$, which ends the procedure. 
	Thus, assume that $(\ar_{-1}) \ileadstost \phi$. 
	
	Pick any $\ar_0 \in \allargs \suchthat \ar_0 \gleadsto[\alpha] \phi$. Observe that $\ar_0 \in \gargsalpha \cap (\dfp[\alpha])^0(\gleadstoinv[\alpha](\phi))$.  Define $\hist = (\ar_{-1}, \ar_0)$ and test whether $\hist \nileadstost \phi$. By \cref{th:endchal}, $(\hist, \ar_0, \ar_{-1})$ is a $\phi/¬\phi$-challenge, thus, $(\hist, \ar_0, \ar_{-1})$ is a challenge of complexity $(0, 0)$.
	
	Suffices now to apply \cref{th:nextchal} repetitively, until finding a falsification instance of $\alpha$ or $\beta$. This is because, given a challenge $(\hist, \ar_\alpha, \ar_\beta)$ of complexity $(k_\alpha, k_\beta)$, \cref{th:nextchal} applies, yielding either a falsification instance, or a new challenge of higher complexity. 
Indeed, if $(\hist, \ar_\alpha)$ challenges $\phi$, apply \cref{th:nextchal} with $\alpha$ for $\gamma$, $\beta$ for $\delta$, and obtain either that $\hist$ falsifies $\alpha$, or a new tuple $(\histp, \ar'_\alpha, \ar_\beta)$ that is a challenge of complexity $(k_\alpha + 1, k_\beta)$.
And if $(\hist, \ar_\beta)$ challenges $¬\phi$, apply \cref{th:nextchal} with $¬\phi$ for $\phi$, $\beta$ for $\gamma$, $\alpha$ for $\delta$, and obtain either that $\hist$ falsifies $\beta$, or a new tuple $(\histp, \ar'_\beta, \ar_\alpha)$ such that $(\histp, \ar_\alpha, \ar'_\beta)$ is a challenge of complexity $(k_\alpha, k_\beta + 1)$.
	
	Given that $\exists K_\alpha \suchthat (\dfp[\alpha])^{K_\alpha}(\gleadstoinv[\alpha](\phi)) = \emptyset$ and $K_\beta \suchthat (\dfp[\beta])^{K_\beta}(\gleadstoinv[\beta](¬\phi)) = \emptyset$ by definition of empirical theories, this process must end with a falsifying instance of $\alpha$ or $\beta$.
\end{procedure}

\subsection{TODO, about comparisons}
Count the number of tests; assume simpler theory.

Indicate sufficient hypothesis for ensuring that if a model resisted every attack, it is valid. Thus, that searching for falsification instances in the tested ones is enough.

Define $P = (.99, +\$4; .01, −\$0.1)$ and $D = (.33, +\$16; .67, −\$2)$.

Theory claims that all $i$’s prefer deliberately $P$ to $D$, in the sense of betting at least as much for.

Define $\phi$ as: $i$ deliberately prefers $P$ to $D$, in the sense of bidding at least as much for $P$ than for $D$ after deliberation. Define $¬\phi$ similarly, but bidding more for $D$ than for $P$. 

Define $\ileadstost$ as follows. Given $\hist = (…, \ar)$, $\hist \ileadstost \phi$ iff, in a situation of $i$ having been exposed to the prefix …, saying: “Considering the argument $\ar$, would you please indicate your maximum selling price for $P$, and for $D$” leads $i$ to act accordig to $\phi$. Note that $\hist \ileadstost \phi$ iff $\hist \nileadstost ¬\phi$.

Thus, the normative axiom is satisfied iff, whenever there is a argument that, facing any counter-argument, leads $i$ to bid at least as much for $P$ than for $D$, we are ready to accept that $i$ deliberately prefers $P$ to $D$, in the bidding sense.

Define $\ar_0$ as arguing that the bid for both P and D should equal their expected revenue, namely, $.99 × (\$4) − 0.01 × \$0.1$ or etc. “Imagine you play this bet 100 times. On average, you will win 99 times and lose 1 time, which means gaining 99 × \$4 = \$396 and losing 1 × \$0.10 = \$0.10, hence a total net gain of \$395.90. Thus, your average net gain for the $P$ bet would be \$3.9590. Etc.”

Define $\ar_1$ as arguing that the utility of money should matter, not the revenue, and arguing that a loss hurts more than a gain. Define $\ar_2$ as arguing that the goal is to maximise average revenue, and thus, losses should count equally to gains. Define $\ar'_1$ as arguing by considering only what is to be gained and not the probabilities, and thus, arguing that $D$ is worth much more. Define $\ar'_2$ as arguing that also the probabilities should be taken into account.
Define $+$ as the simple concatenation of its arguments.

Then, define $\gbeats = \set{(\ar_1, \ar_0), (\ar'_1, \ar_0), (\ar'_1, \ar_2), (\ar_1, \ar'_2)}$, $\dbeats = \set{(\ar_2, \ar_1), (\ar'_2, \ar'_1)}$.

TODO consider using only $\phi$ being sure, and dropping everything related to possibility.

\section{Next}
Define a way of saying “we never need this argument”: either the model can prove phi without s0, or if it can’t, then phi does not hold, because I can play s1 against it. 

What about a model for only one situation? Then we need to accept that $q$ can’t be falsified, and accept that it defines the individual (or just assume without proof that it does not).

Assume $i$, given $\ar$ and $\ar'$, picks repeatedly (in various circumstances) nonempty subsets of $\set{\prop, ¬\prop}$. Define $(\ar', \ar) \ileadstoe (\prop, \text{sure})$ iff she sometimes chooses $\set{\prop}$ and $(\ar', \ar) \ileadstoe (\prop, \text{poss})$ iff she sometimes chooses $\set{\prop}$ or $\set{\prop, ¬\prop}$. Then, $(\ar', \ar) \ileadstost (\prop, \text{sure})$ iff she always chooses $\set{\prop}$ and $(\ar', \ar) \ileadstost (\prop, \text{poss})$ iff she always chooses either $\set{\prop}$ or $\set{\prop, ¬\prop}$.

Discuss variant with an empirical claim: $\hist \ileadsto \phi ⇒ \hist \nileadsto ¬\phi$; and change \cref{ax:norm}: $[\forall \hist, \hist \ileadsto \propposs] ⇒ \propposs \in \iPhi$, … This is essentially what will be done in the following, I suppose.

If we do not have $\propsure$ implies $\propposs$, then we can have $\propsure$ and $\notpropsure$ both accepted. But all propositions of the normative analysis would still hold, it seems. We could have a property that says: $\propsure \in \iPhi ⇒ \propposs \in \iPhi \land \notpropsure \notin \iPhi \land \notpropposs \notin \iPhi$.

Show that if the claim of the model is of a different form, then the model is not falsifiable, as suggested here below for some form of claims.

Extend the definition of additive single-answer theories to non-additive single-answer theories.

An additive theory need not have freedom for defining planned attacks on additive terms: this should be a consequence on the planned attacks on defenses and on initial arguments only. This makes the theory easier to define, as only attacks on partial arguments are to be defined.

General theory says that $\ar_1$ is replaceable (suspects that it’s good for some people): $(\ar_1, \ar_0) \ileadstoe ¬\phi ⇒ (\ar'_1, \ar_0) \ileadstoe ¬\phi$. (This will fail if some $i$ thinks $\ar'_1$ is bad arg because of $\ar_0$ but $\ar_1$ is bad because of $\ar_2$.) It may say that $\ar_1$ is bad. General theory prepares potentially good arg $\ar_0$ and claims that if $\ar_0 \ileadstoe \phi$, then $\ar_0 \ileadstost \phi$ (this is Answerability). So that the model only has to prove the weaker existential claim.

It is important to remark that when the query protocol does not admit observation of “both”, thus, when $\ileadstost$ does not distinguish sure from possible, it does \emph{not} follow that $i$ is sure of either $\prop$ or $¬\prop$ for every pair of proposition: the “undecided” case will hold whenever $i$ considers no argument as sufficiently strong to determine a decisive preference (assuming that in that case, $i$ at least sometimes alternates his choice). Admittedly, it might also happen that $i$ is really indifferent between $\prop$ and $¬\prop$ but still systematically chooses, say, $\prop$ over $¬\prop$, in which case it will be (somewhat) erroneously concluded that $\prop \in \iPhi$. This is the price to pay for using protocols that do not allow to observe indifference. Observe however that (depending on the application) this error might be considered not harmful, as the obtained model will be faithful to $i$’s behavior after deliberation.

\subsection{Example model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\ar_0 = \text{“Veg bec of ethics and health”}$
	\item $\ar_1 = \text{“Ethics is not defined”}$
	\item $\ar_2 = \text{“It is since Aristotle at least”}$
	\item $\ar_1' = \text{“Health isn’t important”}$
	\item $\ar_2' = \text{“Ask my grandmother”}$
	\item $\ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0$, $\ar_1' \gbeats \ar_0$
	\item $\ar_2 \gbeats \ar_1$, $\ar_2' \gbeats \ar_1'$
	\item $\ar_0 + \ar_2 \gbeats \ar_1$
	\item $\ar_1' \gbeats \ar_0 + \ar_2$
	\item $\ar_0 + \ar_2' \gbeats \ar_1'$
	\item $\ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0 + \ar_2'$
	\item $\ar_0 + \ar_2 + \ar_2' \gbeats \ar_1$
	\item $\ar_0 + \ar_2 + \ar_2' \gbeats \ar_1'$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interpreting Answerability}
At a given stage in operationalizing the protocol, define $f(\ar_0)$ as the arguments that are considered as having a chance to attack $\ar_0$ (without backtracking). Thus, this will not include $\ar_1$ if indeed $\ar_2$ is considered by $i$ as a satisfying answer to $\ar_1$. We can interpret Answerability in the following ways. Strong answ: $\exists \ar_1 \in f(\ar_0) \suchthat \ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0$. Weak answ: $f(\ar_0) ≠ \emptyset ⇒ \exists \ar_1' \suchthat \ar_1' \gbeats \ar_0$. Or suppress Answ and replace Op. val. by Strong op. val.: $\forall \phi \in \gPhi, \ar_0 \in \gargs[\phi], \ar_1 \in \allargs: (\ar_1, \ar_0) \ileadstoe ¬\phi ⇒ \exists \ar_2 \in {\gbeatsinv}(\ar_1)$.

A model can be allowed to try only once each answer. If $\ar_2 \gbeats \ar_1 \land \ar_1 \in f(\ar_0 + \ar_2)$, the model has lost.

Thus, four variants, given $\ar_2 \gbeats \ar_1$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Strong answ with single try: $\ar_1 \notin f(\ar_0 + \ar_2) \land \forall \ar_1' \in f(\ar_0 + \ar_2): \ar_1' \gbeats \ar_0 + \ar_2$.
	\item Strong answ with multiple tries: $\forall \ar_1' \in f(\ar_0 + \ar_2): \ar_1' \gbeats \ar_0 + \ar_2$. (Example: $\ar_1 = \text{“for ethical reasons”}$, and $\eta$ knows two c-a to this, from different angles.) 	\item Weak answ with single try: $\ar_1 \notin f(\ar_0 + \ar_2) \land [f(\ar_0 + \ar_2) ≠ \emptyset ⇒ \exists \ar_1' \suchthat \ar_1' \gbeats \ar_0]$.
	\item Weak answ with multiple tries: $f(\ar_0 + \ar_2) ≠ \emptyset ⇒ \exists \ar_1' \suchthat \ar_1' \gbeats \ar_0 + \ar_2$.
\end{itemize}

Goal: leave addition free so as to admit multiple tries, and prove that Strong answ with multiple tries is the right one for a general approach: suitable restriction to the model permits single try (with same conditions); and weak answ actually does not permit more models.

When $f$ is available and is single-valued, question: should we use Strong or weak answ? Right answer: use Strong answ. It is stricly more general. A model that wants weak answ can define its internal attacks suitable (to be proven); and a model that wants to claim more can.

When $f$ is not available, only remains: single try (just give a decisive argument) or multiple tries (try more and more arguments, blindly).

Suppose that a model also defines $f_\eta$, meaning: $f_\eta(\ar_1) = \ar_2$ the argument the model plays against $\ar_1$. Thus $f_\eta$, like $\gbeats$, is a binary relation over $\allargs$, but $f_\eta$ in supplement returns a single argument or none. Also, $\ar_2 = f(\ar_1) ⇒ \ar_2 \gbeats \ar_1$. When a reason $\ar_1$ for rejecting $\ar_0$ is not known, $f_\eta(\ar_0)$ instead gives the argument to be played next. Note that $f_\eta$ is only useful when (in the known c-a variant) for some $\ar_1$ there are multiple candidates $\ar_2$ or when (in the unknown c-a variant) for some $\ar_0$ here are multiple candidates $\ar_2$. In fact, this is more complicated: $f_\eta(\ar_1)$ can give first $\ar_2$, then, if that is not enough, $\ar_4$ (thus it’s rather $f_\eta(\ar_1, \ar_0)$).

Under Strong anws, we ask that $f(\ar_0) \cap {\gbeatsinv}(\ar_0) ≠ \emptyset$, and (inevitably) that $f_\eta(\ar_1) ≠ \emptyset$. Under weak answ, we do not expect anticipation and only demand that $f_\eta(\ar_1) ≠ \emptyset$. But this does not allow supplementary models. TODO prove this.

\subsection{Transitive, complete preference theories}
Given a set of alternatives $\allalts$. Define $\allprops_\allalts = \set{\ppst, a ≠ b \in \allalts} \cup \set{\ppstba, a ≠ b \in \allalts}$. Define $¬_\allalts$ such that $\forall a, b \in \allalts: ¬_\allalts\ppst = \ppstba, ¬_\allalts\ppstba = \ppst$. Define $\Phi_\allalts = \props_\allalts × \set{\mathit{sure}, \mathit{poss}}$.

Let $I$ represent a given set of individuals; $\allalts$ a set of products; 
and $\allargs$ the set of all strings.
Given $i \in I$, define $\ileadstost$ as follows. 
Given $\hist \in \allhist$ and $\phi \in \Phi_\allalts$, with $\phi \in \set{\ppst} × \set{\mathit{sure}, \mathit{poss}}$ for some $a ≠ b \in \allalts$, the individual is presented the arguments in $\hist$, and has then to choose a product from the set $\set{a, b}$. Define $\hist \ileadstost \phi$ iff $i$ chooses $a$. \commentOC{This is inadequate: if $i$ picks $b$ from $\set{a, b, c}$, the current definition considers it compatible with $\ppstsure \in \iPhi$, thus, $\ppst$ does not have a meaningful content. Should rather define $\ppstsure$ so that $a$ is picked rather than $b$ whatever the choice set. This requires to generalize $\ileadstost$.}

Any normative theory of the form $(\allprops_\allalts, ¬_\allalts, \allargs, I, (\ileadsto)_{i \in I})$, for some sets $\allargs$ and $I$, is called a normative theory about $\allalts$.

Given a set $\domc \subseteq \powersetz{\allalts}$, where $\powersetz{\allalts}$ designates the set of subsets of $\allalts$ without the empty set, a function $c: \domc → \allalts$ is a choice function iff $\forall B \in \domc: c(B) \subseteq B$.

Given a normative theory about $\allalts$, an individual $i \in I$, a set $\domc \subseteq \powersetz{\allalts}$ and a choice function $c$, say that $c$ represents a \emph{deliberated choice function} for $i$ iff $\forall B \in \domc: c(B) \subseteq \set{a \in B \suchthat \forall b \in B: \ppstsure[b][a] \notin \iPhi}$.

A normative theory about $\allalts$ is transitive iff $\forall a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a \in \allalts: [\exists \ar_{a \pst b} \in \allargs \suchthat \ar_{a \pst b} \ileadstost \ppstsure] \land [\exists \ar_{b \pst c} \in \allargs \suchthat \ar_{b \pst c} \ileadstost \ppstsure[b][c]] ⇒ [\exists \ar_{a \pst c} \in \allargs \suchthat \ar_{a \pst c} \ileadstost \ppstsure[a][c]]$. 

A set of propositions $P \subseteq \Phi_\allalts$ is transitive iff $\forall a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a \in \allalts: \ppstsure \in P \land \ppstsure[b][c] \in P ⇒ \ppstsure[a][c] \in P$.

A transitive empirical preference theory about $\allalts$ is an empirical theory for a normative theory about $\allalts$ such that $\gPhi$ is transitive.

Associate to such a theory a preference ordering $\succ$ on $\allalts$ as follows: $a \succ b$ iff $\ppstsure \in \gPhi$.

The deliberated preference of $i$ under a normative theory 
Then, observe $a$ incomp to $z$ using a good argument for $a > z$ and one for $z > a$. Observe also $b$ incomp to $z$. And observe $a > b$. This proves incompleteness as $z$ indifferent to the rest is impossible. BUT this requires to observe possibility.

\subsubsection{Transitive arguments}
Given a normative theory and a function $\tau: \allargs × \allargs → \allargs$, say that $\tau$ is a transitive argument builder iff $\forall a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a \in \allalts, \ar_{a \pst b}, \ar_{b \pst c} \in \allargs \suchthat \ar_{a \pst b} \ileadstost \ppstsure \land \ar_{b \pst c} \ileadstost \ppstsure[b][c]: \tau(\ar_{a \pst b}, \ar_{b \pst c}) \ileadstost \ppstsure[a][c]$.

Observe that if a normative theory admits a transitive argument builder, then it is transitive.

TODO It is possible to determine whether a given function $\tau$ is a transitive argument builder empiricially. But not to prove empirically that a normative theory is not transitive.

The object of study in a given decision situation is the deliberated preferences of a given individual $i$. 
A decision situation concerns a topic $\allprops$, given a set of arguments $\allargs$, given a certain query protocol, and over a certain time frame. The relation $\ileadstoall$, to be defined shortly, models the reaction of $i$ to arguments about the topic. The decision situation will be defined as a triple $(\allprops, \allargs, \ileadstoall)$ satisfying some conditions to be defined after having presented those three fundamental elements.

The decision situation relates to a topic denoted by $\allprops$, which is a set of propositions $\prop \in \allprops$ about which we are interested of knowing the deliberated preferences of $i$. Propositions are not described further, but are supposedly understandable by $i$ (for example, they could be sentences in some natural language). Alternatively, in the case of an analyst helping $i$ to make a decision, $\allprops$ is a set of propositions about which $i$ is interested to know his own deliberated preferences. I assume $\allprops$ is closed under negation and introduce a symbol $¬$ for negating a proposition: if $\prop \in \allprops$, then $¬\prop \in \allprops$, and $¬(¬\prop) = \prop$. 

With the decision situation comes also a set of all arguments $\allargs$. This set contains all the arguments that may possibly be considered relevant by $i$ for his decision problem, and possibly more.
Importantly, the notion of deliberated preferences does not require to constrain a priori $\allargs$ to some set of arguments that would fit some precise notion of relevancy, coherence, or even well-formedness. This permits to avoid introducing inadequate normative principles into the deliberated preferences: only the individual $i$ is then considered legitimate to dictate what is a relevant argument. Under that view, $\allargs$ may contain anything that can possibly be considered as an argument by anyone, under the widest possible conception of an argument. The notion of deliberated judgment can however also be applied when considering a restricted set of arguments, for example, the arguments that have been put forward by some specific set of experts when talking about the topic $\allprops$. 

The set $\allargs$ may be infinite or very large: as we will see, thanks to our falsificationist approach, there is no need to be able to explore it entirely. The set of arguments contains at least the empty argument, denoted by $\zar$.

\begin{example}
	Consider a decision problem where a set of alternatives $\allalts$ is given, containing food products among which $i$ would like to form a deliberated preference (taking into account the effects of food on health, price, pleasure, morality issues related to the production process, and so on). The topic could be defined as $\allprops$ = $\set{\prop_\alt, ¬\prop_\alt, \forall \alt \in \allalts}$, where $\prop_\alt$ is the proposition according to which $\alt$ is one of the best alternatives among $\allalts$ (there is no strictly better alternatives among $\allalts$, from $i$’s point of view), and $¬\prop_\alt$ is the proposition according to which $\alt$ is not one of the best alternatives among $\allalts$ (some $\alt' \in \allalts$ is a strictly better alternative, from $i$’s point of view). 
	The set $\allargs$ is defined as the set of all strings, because in this example it is considered acceptable to restrict arguments to those that can take a textual form.
\end{example}

Define $\Phi = \allprops × \set{\text{possible}, \text{sure}}$. Elements in $\Phi$ will also be called propositions, which should create no ambiguity. 
The relation $\ileadstoall \subseteq (\allargs × \allargs) × \Phi$, pronounced “always leads to”, has the following semantics.
Whenever $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoall (\prop, \text{sure})$, $i$ always considers that $\prop$ is sure (meaning that $¬\prop$ is excluded), when presented with these two arguments, and whenever $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoall (\prop, \text{possible})$, $i$ always considers that $\prop$ is “at least” possible (meaning that $¬\prop$ may be possible as well), when presented with these two arguments. In both cases, the term “always” means that the consideration is stable over time, including after having presented other arguments to $i$. 
Two query protocols presented below will illustrate how these semantics might be satisfied. 
However, I voluntarily leave the querying protocol not precisely specified in general, as multiple reasonable choices are possible. The results of this article depend only on assumptions about $\ileadstoall$. 

Define the negation operator $¬$ over $\Phi$ as: $¬(\prop, \text{possible}) = (¬\prop, \text{sure})$ and $¬(\prop, \text{sure}) = (¬\prop, \text{possible})$. It follows that $¬¬\phi = \phi$. Write $(\ar, \ar') \nileadstoall \phi$ for $¬[(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoall \phi]$ and define $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoe \phi$ as equivalent to $(\ar, \ar') \nileadstoall ¬\phi$. 
The relation $\ileadstoe$ is pronounced “sometimes leads to”.
A proposition $\phi$ is about $\prop$ iff $\phi \in \{\prop, ¬\prop\} × \{\text{possible}, \text{sure}\}$. 

The pair $(\ar, \ar')$ is to be understood as unordered (thus $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoall \prop ⇔ (\ar', \ar) \ileadstoall \prop$).

\begin{definition}[Decision situation]
	A decision situation is a topic $\allprops$ closed under negation, a set of arguments $\allargs$, an “always leads to” relation $\ileadstoall \subseteq (\allargs × \allargs) × \Phi$ satisfying (A1) and (A2) and using unordered pairs of arguments, $\Phi$ being the set of propositions $\allprops × \set{\text{sure}, \text{possible}}$.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Query protocols}
As vNM aptly summarize, “It is clear that every measurement – or rather every claim of measurability – must ultimately be based on some immediate sensation, which possibly cannot and certainly need not be analyzed any futher.” The fundamental element here is the reaction of $i$ to arguments, which will serve as the informational basis to define $\ileadstoall$. Given a proposition $\prop$ and two arguments $\ar, \ar' \in \allargs$, a query consists in presenting both arguments to $i$ and observing which proposition $i$ considers valid in her current state of mind, thus using both arguments and possibly other arguments she has in mind: is it that $\prop$ holds, that $¬\prop$ holds, or that both are possible? The third possibility allows for the case where no argument appears more decisive than the other one. 

It is also necessary to capture the evolution of the position of $i$ towards arguments over time: a repeated query using a given pair of arguments may yield different answers, for example because the repeated question has been interleaved with another query containing other arguments (which $i$ may still have in mind when answering the second repetition), or for any other known or unknown reason. The important information for us is the \emph{set} of answers that $i$ could give to a query involving two given arguments and a given topic, among the set $\{\prop, ¬\prop, \text{both}\}$. The set designates all possible answers over time and over different order of asking the queries.
Hence, given $\prop \in \allprops$, define a relation $\ileadstoprop \subseteq (\allargs × \allargs) × \powersetz{\{\prop, ¬\prop, \text{both}\}}$, where $\powersetz{B}$ designates the subsets of $B$ excluding the emptyset, with the semantics that $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoprop C$, with $C \subseteq \set{\prop, ¬\prop, \text{both}}$, iff $\forall c \in C$, it is observable at least once that $i$, when presented with $(\ar, \ar')$, considers $c$ valid in her current state of mind. The querying protocol is supposedly made so that for any $\prop \in \allprops$, $\ileadstoprop = \ileadstonprop$.

This information is only indirectly observable: for example, if $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoprop \{\prop\}$, a querier will never know more than $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoprop C$ with $\prop \in C \subseteq \set{\prop, ¬\prop, \text{both}}$. 
Also, it may be only possible to test one ordering of the queries (assuming that $i$ forgets over time might permit to test different orderings, but this assumption might be unrealistic). In some cases, it may even be only possible to test a single query with a given individual.
This limitation of our observation will not be a problem for the results of this article. Intuitively, this bears on the fact that, first, theories apply to multiple individuals, and second, if a theory claims that $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoprop \{\prop\}$, then either this claim is correct, or it is falsifiable, in the sense that there is a possibility of observing a contradiction to its claim.

To be more concrete, one possible choice of a query protocol, when arguments and propositions are strings, is to read both arguments to $i$, together with $\prop$, and ask $i$ to verbally report the choice he opts for among the three possibilities. Another is to present both arguments and ask $i$ to pick an item among some choice set and make the choice correspond to a validation of $\prop$ or $¬\prop$, possibly even letting the choice engage $i$, for example telling $i$ that she may keep the object of choice (this is illustrated in \cref{ex:pick}). This second possibility is especially interesting as it makes the protocol partially observable in the restricted sense usually appreciated in revealed preferences approaches. Note that depending on the protocol, the choice “both” is not necessarily observable (more about this below).
%In that case, the semantics of $\prop$ and $¬\prop$ relatedly change: instead of meaning that $\prop$ is definitely the 
%Indeed, \citet{tversky_intransitivity_1969} note that individuals “are not perfectly consistent in their choices. When faced with repeated choices between x and y, people often choose x in some instances and y in others. Furthermore, such inconsistencies are observed even in the absence of systematic changes in the decision maker’s taste which might be due to learning or sequential effects. It seems, therefore, that the observed inconsistencies reflect inherent variability or momentary fluctuation in the evaluative process.” This is an accepted fact of experimental psychology \citep{luce_utility_2000}. However, it is reasonable to suspect that fluctuations occur less often, if at all, for some choices. For example, facing a choice between tea or coffee, I would virtually never pick tea (all other things being equal). We are interested in capturing precisely those kind of preferences.

One can also use $\zar$ as one or both of the arguments, in which case the protocol queries the preference of $i$ given only one or given no argument.

\begin{example}[cont.]
	\label{ex:pick}
	Continuing the example, define the querying protocol as, given $\prop_\alt$, presenting two arguments to $i$ and let $i$ choose an item among $\allalts$. $i$ may keep the chosen item. 
	If $i$ chooses $\alt$, it is considered that $i$ has validated $\prop_\alt$, otherwise, $¬\prop_\alt$. The option “both” is not observable.
%	Queries are separated by one week at least, which (as supposed in this example) is enough to ensure that no effect of pleasure for variability enter into play. 
\end{example}

Define $\ileadstoall$ from $\ileadstoprop$ as follows, for any $\prop \in \allprops$: $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoall (\prop, \text{possible}) ⇔ (\ar, \ar') \ileadstoprop C$ with $C \subseteq \set{\prop, \text{both}}$; and $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoall (\prop, \text{sure}) ⇔ (\ar, \ar') \ileadstoprop \set{\prop}$. 

Note that (A1) and (A2) hold.

When “both” is not observable, $\ileadstoall$ is defined as: $(\ar, \ar') \ileadstoall (\prop, \text{possible}) ⇔ (\ar, \ar') \ileadstoall (\prop, \text{sure}) ⇔ (\ar, \ar') \ileadstoprop \set{\prop}$. (A1) and (A2) still hold. We say in this case that $\ileadstoall$ does not distinguish sure from possible. Thus, elements $\phi \in \Phi$ may be considered as simply equal to $\prop$ or $¬\prop$, as $(\prop, \text{sure})$ is treated exactly as $(\prop, \text{possible})$.

\subsection{Example}
\begin{example}[(cont.)]
	Returning to the previous example, a theory $T$ could claim that, for all individuals that belong to some given socio-economic situation and that have some given degree (described by the theory in sufficient details that it is possible to determine precisely to which kind of individuals it applies), $(\prop_a, \text{sure})$ is in the deliberated preferences of the individuals, for a given alternative $\alt$ also described by $T$. 
The theory also suggests some argument $\ar$, a text that (according to $T$) will convince any individual (fitting the description) that $\prop_\alt$ holds, thus, that $\alt$ is a “good” food product for him. 
The theory can be put to the test by picking an individual fitting the description, presenting the argument together with any other argument (for example, proposed by another theory), and observing whether $i$ is convinced.
$T$ resists to such a falsification test if $i$ is convinced. According to a previous theorem, $T$ tells the truth if it would resist to any possible falsification test. (This is impossible to definitely make sure of.)
\end{example}
This example illustrates a difference between this proposal and the classical revealed approach: it could be that $T$ tells the truth even though its claim does not correspond to the revealed preference of some individuals, thus that, given no argument, some individuals would consider $a$ as dominated by another alternative in the set considered. It also illustrates a difference between this proposal and persuasion: the goal of $T$ is not merely to convince $i$ (possibly by using its lack of knowledge of any counter-argument to what $T$ says), but to resist any falsification attempt. Thus, $T$ should be confronted to arguments coming from as varied perspectives as possible, in order to give confidence that it tells the truth.

\section{Empirical theories}
\subsection{Simple to complex}
From an additive single-answer empirical theory, we can define a function: $\forall \ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0: f(\ar_1, \ar_0) = \ar_0 + {\gbeatsinv}(\ar_1) = \set{\ar_0 + \ard \suchthat \ard \in {\gbeatsinv}(\ar_1)}$, and $f(\ar_1, \ar_0) = \emptyset$ otherwise. Thus, $f = \set{((\ar_1, \ar_0), \ar_2) \suchthat \exists \ard \in \allargs \suchthat \ard \gbeats \ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0 \land \ar_2 = \ar_0 + \ard}$.
Also, from the previous definition, $g(\ar_0)(\ar_0 + \argsd_2) = dom(f^{-1}(\ar_0 + \argsd_2) \cap (\allargs × \set{\ar_0})) = {\gbeats}(\argsd_2) \cap {\gbeatsinv}(\ar_0)$ because $(\ar_1, \ar_0) \in f^{-1}(\ar_0 + \argsd_2) ⇔ \exists \ar_2 \in \ar_0 + \argsd_2 \suchthat \ar_2 \in f(\ar_1, \ar_0) ⇔ \ar_1 \gbeats \ar_0 \land \exists \ard \in \argsd_2 \suchthat \ard \gbeats \ar_1$.
\commentOC{Could be false.}

Note that $f^{-1}(\ar_0 + \ar_2) ≠ {\gbeats}(\ar_2) × \set{\ar_0}$: if ${\gbeats} = \set{(\ard, \ar_1), (\ar_1, \ar_0), (\ard[6], \ar_5), (\ar_5, \ar_4)}$, and $\ar_0 + \ard = \ar_4 + \ard[6]$, then $f^{-1}(\ar_0 + \ard) = f^{-1}(\ar_4 + \ard[6]) = \set{(\ar_1, \ar_0), (\ar_5, \ar_4)}$ and ${\gbeats}(\ard) × \set{\ar_0} = \set{(\ar_1, \ar_0)}$.
Also, note that $g(\ar_0)(\ar_0 + \argsd_2) ≠ {\gbeats}(\argsd_2) \cap {\gbeatsinv}(\ar_0)$. Consider ${\gbeats} = \set{(\ard, \ar_1), (\ar_1, \ar_0)}, \ar_2 = \ar_0 + \ard = \ar_0 + \ard$. Then, $(\ar_1, \ar_0) \in f^{-1}(\ar_0 + \ard)$, hence, $\ar_1 \in g(\ar_0)(\ar_0 + \ard)$, but ${\gbeats}(\ard) = \emptyset$.

\subsection{Falsifiability}
\commentOC{I should define $\Box(\hist \ileadsto \phi)$ iff it has been observed that $\hist \ileadsto \phi$. Then, axiom Correct observations (that is self-evident): $\Box(\hist \ileadsto \phi) ⇒ \hist \ileadsto \phi$ (what has been observed is). Supplementary axiom Falsification is enough (that is not self-evident): $\not\Box(\hist \ileadsto \phi) ⇒ \hist \nileadsto \phi$ (what has not been observed is not).}

\commentOC{I want: An empirical theory for a normative theory is something like a normative and falsifiable claim. It is also configurable: it must be possible to guarantee that the falsification be easy (if the claim is false) depending on the kind of claim.}

Given $\hist \in \allhist$ and $i \in I$, the claim $\hist \ileadstoe[i] \phi$ may not be verifiable, and is too specific to be falsifiable. However, given $\hist \in \allhist$, a broader claim is falsifiable: that for a given set of individuals $Q \subseteq I, \forall i \in Q, \hist \ileadstoe[i] \phi$ (provided $Q$ is big enough). Indeed, that claim it is equivalent to $\nexists i \in Q \suchthat \hist \nileadstoe[i] \phi$; exhibiting an $i \in Q$ such that $\hist \nileadstoe[i] \phi$ thus falsifies the broader claim.

Given any $(\allprops, ¬, \allargs, I)$, an \emph{observation protocol} is a binary tree whose non-leaf nodes are among $I × \allhist × \Phi$ and whose two edges out of any non leaf node are labeled by “yes” and “no”; the leaf nodes being simply $\emptyset$. The observation protocol is said to assume memory iff for each non-leaf node $n = (i, \hist, \phi)$ about $i$, any node $n' = (i, {\hist}', \phi')$ about $i$ that is further down the tree continues the history, that is, the sequence ${\hist}'$ starts with $\hist$. Given an observation protocol and observables $(\ileadstoe[i])_{i \in I}$, the \emph{observed path} refers to the path in the tree defined recursively as consisting of the root node and, for each non-leaf node $n = (i, \hist, \phi)$ in the path, the child node along the branch “yes” if $\hist \ileadstoe[i] \phi$ and the child node along the branch “no” otherwise. The \emph{observations} refer to the set of nodes along the observed path.

Given any $(\allprops, ¬, \allargs, I)$, a \emph{normative claim} about $(\allprops, ¬, \allargs, I)$ (or about $\allargs$, when the other defined objects are left implicit) is any first-order logic proposition involving the atoms $[(\hist, \phi) \in {\ileadstoe[i]}], \hist \in \allhist, \phi \in \Phi$ which, together with the axioms, permits to deduce that $\phi \in \iPhi$ for some $i \in I$ and $\phi \in \Phi$. The claim is said to be \emph{about} the given set $\allargs$. An observation protocol, together with observables $(\ileadstoe[i])_{i \in I}$, \emph{falsifies} a normative claim iff the falsity of the claim is deducible from the axioms and the observations. A normative claim is \emph{falsifiable} iff there exists a finite observation protocol such that for any observables $(\ileadstoe[i])_{i \in I} \in (\allhist × \Phi)^I$, if the claim is false given these observables, then it is possible to deduce it from the axioms and the observations given the observables.

\commentOC{Falsifiable may not be the right word. Perhaps “provable“, meaning “tautological or Popper-falsifiable”. “Falsifiable” suggests that if a claim is not falsifiable, then a weaker claim is not falsifiable either, which does not hold. My falsifiability criterion demands that if a claim is false, we can see it; whether Popper’s demands that the claim be possibly false. Perhaps I should demand that we can pick a set of consequences of the claim and show it wrong it at least one possible state of the universe.}

A normative claim is \emph{trivial} iff it is about a singleton $\allargs = \set{\ar}$, and has the form: $\ar \ileadstosts \phi$, for some $i \in I$. A normative claim is minimal iff it has the form: $\exists \ar \in \allargs \suchthat \ar \ileadstosts \phi$, for some $i \in I$ and $\phi \in \Phi$. Note that given a minimal claim, $\card{\allargs} = 1$ is equivalent to the claim being trivial.

\begin{proposition}[Trivial claims are not falsifiable]
	Given any $(\allprops, ¬, \allargs ≠ \emptyset, I)$, no minimal normative claim is falsifiable.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Consider any claim about some $i$ and some $\phi$ and any finite observation protocol. We have to show that for some observables, the claim is false, but it is impossible to observe it (meaning, to deduce it from the axioms and observations).
	
	Given $k \in \N$, define $\ileadstosts[k]$ as $\ar^k \ileadstosts \phi$ and $\ar^{k+1} \ileadstosts ¬\phi$ (where $\ar^k$ designates a finite sequence repeating $k$ times $\ar$, for $\ar \in \allargs$). I claim that for some $k$, the observables that include this relation makes the claim false, but not observably so. This is because the observation protocol is finite, thus, only permits to observe some finite number of instances of the relation $\ileadsto$. Suffices to define $k$ as that number.
\end{proof}

There is another reason for non falsifiability, which does not involve the problem of finiteness.
\begin{proposition}[Minimal non-trivial claims are not falsifiable]
	Given any $(\allprops, ¬, \allargs, I), \card{\allargs} ≥ 2$, no minimal normative claim is falsifiable.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Define $\ar_1$ as the first element of the sequence $\hist$ of the root node of the observation protocol (if the observation protocol is empty, suffices to define any observables that make the claim false). Define the observables so that $\forall \hist \in \allhist: \ar_2, \hist \ileadsto ¬\phi$. This proves that no argument is decisive, hence $\phi \notin \Box\Phi$, and the claim is false. But the observables may also be defined so as to satisfy the protocol (defined as: when going through the protocol, the observations can’t fail the claim).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Definition}
A general empirical theory for a normative theory $(\allprops, ¬, \allargs, I, (\ileadstoe[i])_{i \in I})$ is a tuple $({\gleadsto}, f)$, where ${\gleadsto} \subseteq \allargs × \Phi$ and $f \subseteq (\allargs × \allargs) × \allargs$ with $f(\allargs × \allargs)$ being finite.

Define $g(\ar_0) \subseteq \allargs × \allargs$ as $g(\ar_0) = \set{(\ar_2, \ar_1) \suchthat \ar_2 \in f(\ar_1, \ar_0)} = \bigcup_{\ar_1 \in \allargs} (f(\ar_1, \ar_0) × \set{\ar_1})$. The set $g(\ar_0)(\allargs)$ contains the planned attacks on $\ar_0$; the set $g(\ar_0)(\ar_2)$ contains the planned attacks on $\ar_0$ for which $\ar_2$ is a planned response; and the set $g(\ar_0)^{-1}(\ar_1) = f(\ar_1, \ar_0)$ contains the planned protections of $\ar_0$ against $\ar_1$. 

Given $\ar_0 \in \allargs$ and $\args_2 \subseteq \allargs$, define the set $\args_1 \subseteq \allargs$ of arguments that $\args_2$ protects $\ar_0$ from as $\args_1 = [f^{-1}(\args_2)]^{-1}(\ar_0) = \set{\ar_1 \in \allargs \suchthat f(\ar_1, \ar_0) \cap \args_2 ≠ \emptyset} = g(\ar_0)(\args_2) = dom(f^{-1}(\args_2) \cap \allargs × \set{\ar_0})$.
 
\subsection{A general condition sufficient for validity and (hopefully) falsifiability}
It should be possible to define this condition as a claim that does not involve $f$, so that it can be done before defining an empirical theory. Then, show that a normative and falsifiable claim must have the form of a convincingness claim.

\begin{remark}
	In fact, the model is tasked with finding a stable point after interrogating $i$. The process of trying counter-arguments $\ar_1, …$ is $q(i)$. When done, the model claims that $\ar_0 + \ar_2 + …$ is decisive. The model also claims that another process of interrogation does not lead to different answers. This is falsifiable.
	When claiming that $(\ar_1, \ar_0) \ileadstoall[i] \phi$, the model really claims that $\nexists p, i' \in q^{-1}(q(i)) \suchthat p, \ar_1, \ar_0 \ileadsto[i'] ¬\phi \lor p, \ar_0, \ar_1 \ileadsto[i'] ¬\phi$, where $i' \in q^{-1}(q(i))$ iff $q(i) = q(i')$.
	
	To say that $\phi \in \iPhi$, need to not depend on choice of $q$, in the following sense: if with $q$, $\phi$ seems stable, but with $q'$, $¬\phi$ seems stable, then $\phi$ is not proved as being in $\iPhi$. But if with $q$, $\phi$ seems stable, but with $q'$, nothing can be shown to be stable, then $\phi$ is proved (temporarily) as being in $\iPhi$. More precisely, after $q'$, the model must be able to stabilize $i$ with its $q$.
\end{remark}

$\ar_0$ $i$-defends $\phi$ when ignoring $S_1$ iff $\forall \hist \in \allhist: [\args_1 \cap \hist = \emptyset] ⇒ (\hist, \ar_0) \ileadstosts \phi$.
$\ar_0$ $i$-defends $\phi$ under protection of $S_2$ iff $\ar_0$ $i$-defends $\phi$ when ignoring $g(\ar_0)(\args_2)$.

\begin{definition}[Convincingness]
	$\forall i \in I, \phi \in \gPhi, \exists k \in 2\N$ and a finite sequence $(\args_j)_{j \in 2\N, j ≤ k} \suchthat \emptyset ≠ \args_0 \subseteq {\gleadstoinv}(\phi)$ and $\forall j \in 2\N, j ≤ k, \forall \ar_j \in S_j: \ar_j$ $i$-defends $\phi$ under protection of $S_{j + 2}$ (defining $S_{k + 2} = \emptyset$) and $S_j \subseteq \cup_{\ar_{j - 2} \in \args_{j - 2}, \ar_{j - 1} \in \allargs} f(\ar_{j - 1}, \ar_{j - 2})$.
\end{definition}
Note that requiring that $\args_0$ be a singleton does not modify the condition, in the sense that any theory satisfying the condition also satisfies its strenghtening. Similarly, requiring that $S_k ≠ \emptyset$ does not modify the condition (because if some $k$ satisfy the condition with $S_k = \emptyset$, then picking $k' = k-2$ with the same sets $S_j$ also satisfy the condition, and because $S_0 ≠ \emptyset$, this recursion must end with a suitable $k$).

\begin{remark}
	The claim must have the form: some structure is adequate for all individuals. Here, the structure is given by $f$. The claim should claim that looking at the attacks planned by $f$ is enough; and looking at the defenses planned by $f$ is enough.

	This may be adequate as if $\ar_0$ seems suitable but some unplanned attacker $\ar_1$ attacks it, then use $\ar_1 \in \hist$ and observe that $¬(\hist, \ar_0) \ileadstoe \phi$ to deny the claim.
	
	Perhaps this could be phrased as follows. Say that $\ar_2$ is replaceable by $\args_2$ iff what $\ar_2$ protects is either protected by $\args_2$ or replaceable (by what?). Say that a set $\args$ is sufficient iff its complement is replaceable by $\args$. Then $g$ claims (among others) that $g(\ar_0)^{-1}(\ar_1)$ is sufficient.
	
	The claim can (hopefully) be given the form: $\forall i \suchthat …, \ar$ decisive. Given $i$, either $\ar_0$ is decisive, or $\ar_1$ attacks it but then $\ar_2$ is decisive, …
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}
	If an empirical theory is convincing, and its normative theory satisfies the axioms, then it is valid.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Consider $i \in I$ and $\phi \in \gPhi$. 
	By hypothesis, $\exists k$ such that some $\ar_k \in \args_k$ defends $\phi$ under protection of $\emptyset$. Therefore, $\ar_k \ileadstosts \phi$. Using \cref{ax:norm}, validity follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	The convincingness claim of any empirical theory is falsifiable: given an ET, there exists a finite obs prot with memory such that for any observables, if the claim is false given these observables, then it is possible to deduce it from the axioms and observations.
\end{theorem}
